Appendix

In this section, all the assumptions and logic for the calculations in the final
few figures are explained. Clearly not all assumptions are 100% accurate, but the goal
of this project is to provide an idea for the scope of the problem. While not
exact, these assumptions give us the ability to estimate certain statistics.

To calculate the number of people are addicted to opioids in each state, we did the following steps.
First, we took the ratio: number of people with addiction nationally to number
of people who died from opioids nationally would be the same for states. The value of
this number is 28.5. We assumed this ratio to be constant across
Using this assumption, we calculated the number of people
addicted to opioids in each state by doing: 28.5 * number of people who died from
opioids in that state for 2017.

To calculate the maximum number of people doctors can prescribe Buprenorphine per state,
we took the following steps. Using the Samhsa website, https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/physician-program-data/certified-physicians,
we wrote a script that summed up the total number of doctors certified to treat 30 and 100 patients. Call
lower_amount = # doctors certified to treat 30 patients, upper_amount = # doctors certified to treat 100 patients.
Then we assumed the following:
average number of patients a certified doctor can treat = (100 * upper_amount + 30*(lower_amount-upper_amount))/(lower_amount+upper_amount)

Call this ratio avg_numpatients. Using the samhsa map locator for doctors, we found
the number of doctors in each state legally able to prescribe Buprenorphine. However,
not all doctors that can prescribe Buprenorphine are in the map locator. Given only
19K doctors are legally able to prescribe Buprenorphine according to the map,
while in reality 33K doctors exist with the ability to prescribe Buprenorphine,
all values for the number of doctors legally able to prescribe Buprenorphine in each
state were multiplied by 33/19. Given the assumptions, this series of calculations would produce
the estimate of the number of doctors that can prescribe Buprenorphine for each
state for later calculations.

Given these assumptions, to calculate the maximum number of people doctors can prescribe
Buprenorphine per state, avg_numpatients was multiplied to the estimated number of doctors that can
prescribe Buprenorphine in each state.

These assumptions and calculations formed the basis for all the figures and
graphs seen in this visualization.
